# NFA Simulator
This project simulates the behavior of a nondeterministic finite automaton to determine whether a string is in a particular defined language. The program uses an algorithm to convert the nfa (defined through the nfa txt files), into an equivalent dfa. The function from project 1 (dfa simulator) is called to similarly verify the string.
